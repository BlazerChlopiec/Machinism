TODO:
- practically remove all static variables since its 1. bad practice 2. a bad solution
- improve on the canvas sorting layers
- wave count on screen
- research a way to remove as much dependencies as possible
- rework the shop message (the shop messege is not correctly displayed, maybe even add a new tweening library)
- fix the main menu bug where you can't set a camera to the canvas or it stops rendering (so weird lmao have trouble fixing)
- DestroyOnInvisible on on big objects with a lot of children just isn't practical
- check if everything is frame independent
- add the focus mechanic (using the breaks slows down all enemies on screen and their bullets)
- make health visible below the player
- polish the shop (maybe add short image descriptions to buttons?)
- bosses (enemies that spawn after a certain time (ex. 5 mins) and disable other enemy spawns after they're destroyed they drop gem currency)

Idk:
- add hitStop effects when hit enemy
- add a Time.timeScale controller script
- timed speed booster affectable item
- timed money booster affectable item

Not needed:
- ignore input in game when clicked on UI

Android port:
- add gem currecy (added for killing specific enemies, surviving for a long time or getting an achievement)
- add cloud saving
- add a gem currency shop (customization purposes - colors, strobe lights, laser light, shoot origins, patterns)

Misc:
- better timer code that allows for unidentifiable timers (the ones that are just created and never referenced)
- move back player sprite on shoot
